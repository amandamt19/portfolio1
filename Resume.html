                  Avoid general text for links. Instead, use your
                  writing skills and contextualize the link.
                  Also, be sure to create a "/assets/docs" directory,
                  so you have a place to put documents, such as your
                  resume.

                  Also, why use a heading element? Plus, since this
                  is a footer, you could also provide your contact info.
                  Now, I understand if you just want to put some fake info,
                  if you would like to avoid sharing that info in this context.
                  The same goes for your PDF.

                    P: Add fake contact info in this footer
